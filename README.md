# Artefice (Dream)

Artefice is an experimental AI-powered custom clothing brand that originated in 2022-2023. The project was born from a simple idea during a late-night conversation with friends: "how cool would it be if we had custom t-shirts of a cow that's getting high!". Funny enough, this sparked the realization that AI image generation could revolutionize custom clothing design.

## The Story

What started as a fun conversation about quirky t-shirt designs evolved into a full-fledged e-commerce platform. Using Stable Diffusion and DALL-E, we created an intuitive interface that allows customers to generate unique clothing designs through text prompts. The platform successfully processed and delivered approximately 75 t-shirts during its initial run.

While the technology worked beautifully, we ultimately discovered that the main challenges lay not in the tech stack but in distribution and manufacturing logistics. This experience provided valuable insights into the intersection of AI, e-commerce, and fashion retail.
